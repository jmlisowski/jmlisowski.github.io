Hello! I am Jake Lisowski. I love to code and swim. I am 11 years old and strive to reach my goals!
### Hey, dude, you're only 11
I know, calm down, I'm a professional...





...procrastinator.
### So, what do I do on here?
I make games, and publish my little projects, and I am working on a JS library to make coding easier and more accessible(I will publish them later).
